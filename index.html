	<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
<p>I am a twenty one year-old free spirit looking to begin a career in coding.</p>
	<p>Even though I consider myself a creator, my main passion is travelling and 
	this career path will hopefully allow me the freedom to support me while 
	living on the road full-time.</p>
	
	<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
<p>I have worked several service industry jobs, including part-time work as a barista and waitress.</p>
	<p>I was Captain of the cross country team at Riverside High School in my senior year and took on a handful of responsibilities.</p>
	
	<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
<p>Although my time in races has passed, I still enjoy running several days a week and stretching every day to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
	<p>I also like to read and write to flex my creative muscles, as well as practice the piano and a moderate meditation regimen.</p>
